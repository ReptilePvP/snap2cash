# Project Progress: Snap2Cash

## Current Status (As of Initialization of Backend Task)

*   **Overall Project Phase:** Early development, focusing on core backend infrastructure for image handling.
*   **Memory Bank:** Just initialized. Core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created.

## What Works / Existing Components

*   **Frontend Foundation:** A React + TypeScript frontend application exists, built with Vite.
    *   Key UI components relevant to image upload and analysis are present:
        *   `components/ImageUpload.tsx`
        *   `components/LiveScanner.tsx`
        *   `pages/AnalysisPageBase.tsx`
        *   Various analysis-specific pages (`AnalyzeGemini.tsx`, etc.)
    *   User authentication and management components (`SignIn.tsx`, `CreateAccount.tsx`) suggest these features are planned or partially implemented.
*   **No Backend Yet:** The specific backend service for image uploads to GCS, as described in the current task, does not exist yet.

## What's Left to Build (Current Task Focus)

1.  **Node.js/Express Backend Service (`/server` directory):**
    *   **Project Setup:**
        *   Initialize `npm` project in `/server`.
        *   Install all required dependencies (`express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `@google-cloud/storage`, `multer`, `uuid`, `typescript`, and type definitions).
        *   Configure `tsconfig.json` for the backend.
        *   Create `.env` file for environment variables.
    *   **Core Logic Implementation:**
        *   `server/index.ts`: Express application setup, middleware integration (CORS, body parsers), route mounting, server start.
        *   `server/middleware/multer.ts`: Configure `multer` for single file uploads, potentially with file type/size limits.
        *   `server/utils/gcsUploader.ts`:
            *   Initialize GCS client (using `service-account.json`).
            *   Implement function to upload a file buffer/stream to GCS.
            *   Construct and return the public GCS URL.
        *   `server/routes/uploadImage.ts`:
            *   Define the `POST /api/upload-image` route.
            *   Use `multer` middleware to handle the incoming file.
            *   Generate a unique filename (e.g., `uuidv4() + path.extname(file.originalname)`).
            *   Call the `gcsUploader` utility.
            *   Return JSON response (`{ success: true, imageUrl: ... }` or error).
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the backend.

2.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Modify `components/ImageUpload.tsx` to:
        *   Use `FormData` to prepare the image file for sending.
        *   Make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:<BACKEND_PORT>/api/upload-image` (or a configurable API base URL).
        *   Handle the JSON response (success or error).

3.  **Deployment Preparation (Google Cloud Run):**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` for the backend service.
    *   Define `npm start` and `npm run build` (for TypeScript) scripts in `server/package.json`.
    *   Document environment variables needed for Cloud Run (e.g., `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` content or path).

## Known Issues / Blockers (Anticipated)

*   **`service-account.json`:** Ensuring this file is correctly placed for local development and handled securely for deployment (not committed).
*   **CORS Configuration:** Needs to be correctly set up on the backend to allow requests from the frontend's origin.
*   **GCS Bucket Permissions:** The service account used must have appropriate permissions (`Storage Object Creator`, `Storage Object Viewer`) on the `snap2cash-uploads` bucket. The bucket must exist or be created.
*   **TypeScript Configuration:** Ensuring both frontend and new backend TypeScript configurations are correct and do not conflict if managed under a monorepo-like structure (though currently they are separate).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial State:** Project started with a frontend and a request to add a backend for image uploads.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Decision made to create the core Memory Bank files first to establish a baseline understanding and context tracking mechanism, as per Cline's operational protocol. This is crucial for long-term maintainability and effective task execution across sessions.
