# Plan for README.md

This document outlines the plan for creating a comprehensive `README.md` for the Snap2Cash project.

## 1. Project Title & Tagline
*   **Title:** `Snap2Cash`
*   **Tagline:** A web application to upload, process, and analyze images to extract structured data and insights.

## 2. Badges
*   Include placeholders for:
    *   Build Status
    *   Code Coverage
    *   Version
    *   License (MIT)

## 3. Project Overview
*   Explain that Snap2Cash is a tool designed to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
*   Describe the core problem: the inefficiency of manually extracting information from images.
*   Highlight the value proposition: saving time and effort by providing a streamlined process to digitize and analyze visual information.
*   Mention the target audience: general consumers, professionals, and resellers.

## 4. Key Features
*   **Image Upload:** Effortlessly upload images via a web interface.
*   **Multiple Analysis Services:** Integrate with various APIs (Gemini, SerpAPI, etc.) to provide diverse insights.
*   **Cloud Storage:** Securely store images using Google Cloud Storage.
*   **User Management:** Support for user accounts, including settings and history.
*   **Dashboard:** A central hub for users to view their activity and analysis results.

## 5. Live Demo / Screenshots
*   Add a placeholder section for a future live demo link.
*   Include placeholders for screenshots showcasing the upload process and results display.

## 6. Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Framer Motion
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
*   **Database/Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
*   **APIs & Services:** SerpApi, Google Gemini

## 7. Installation & Setup
*   **Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm.
*   **Cloning:** `git clone <repository-url>`
*   **Backend Setup:**
    *   `cd backend/server`
    *   `npm install`
    *   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
    *   Populate `.env` with necessary keys (e.g., `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`, `SERPAPI_KEY`).
*   **Frontend Setup:**
    *   `cd ../../` (back to root)
    *   `npm install` (for root dependencies like `concurrently`)
*   **Running the App:**
    *   `npm run dev` (from the root directory) to start both frontend and backend concurrently.

## 8. Usage
*   Explain how to navigate to the upload page.
*   Describe the process of selecting an image and initiating an analysis.
*   Provide an example of the expected JSON response from an analysis API.

## 9. Contributing
*   Encourage contributions from the community.
*   Link to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines.

## 10. License
*   State that the project is distributed under the MIT License.
